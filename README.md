### ✨ Welcome ✨

Greetings to all
I am a person who is always trying to learn and improve every day. I consider myself a creative person who looks for solutions or fun ways to do things. I believe that we can all work together to make this world a better place.
I have worked in various web programming projects; websites, programs, systems, shops, among others. In frontend and backend.
I like programming, audiovisual production and participating in interesting projects.
I think it's great when we work as a team and make something we are satisfied with.
I'm always happy to help others!
